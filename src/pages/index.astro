            As an indie developer, I&apos;ve been spending hours and ghours at
            my desk every day. So, I&apos;ve been continuously improving my
            workspace in order to boost my productivity. Whenever I upload new
            content, people ask me what tools I use. So, here is a living
            snapshot and a place to point curious developers to when I get
            asked. Most of theme links are amazon affiliate links, so I&apos;ll
            get filthy rich if you click them and buy something.
